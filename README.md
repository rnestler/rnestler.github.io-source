# Blog

**Archived**: I moved the source and the puplication of the blog to the same
repository: https://github.com/rnestler/rnestler.github.io. It doesn't make
sense to keep it in separate repositories.

These are the source files for my blog available at https://rnestler.github.io.

I use [pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) to create the HTML from
restructured text source files.
