:summary: Visiting Sarajevo

My BlaBlaCar ride [#]_ to Sarajevo was a very pleasant experience.  My driver
was really nice, we talked a lot, and he explained my the different places
while we were passing by.  I loved the experience of entering Bosnia when
suddenly the whole landscape looks different, with lots of hills and forests.

We then arrived in the early afternoon in Sarajevo.  Quite early during my
"Tour de Hackerspace" `Czesiek`_ offered `via Twitter`_ to show me around
Sarajevo when I get there for a visit, which I found quite amazing!  So I
arranged with him to couch surf at his place and meet him there in the evening.

Since I had the whole afternoon to explore the city I decided to store my
luggage in a nearby hostel and wander around the old town of the city.  I had
some of the `Bosnian coffee`_ and tried the Ćevapi for late lunch.

At some point during the afternoon, I noticed that I forgot my Ferris plushie
in the BlaBlaCar!  So I contacted the driver again and we arranged to meet the
next day in the morning.

In the evening I met with Czesiek and after placing my luggage in his flat, we
proceeded to go to a micro brewery to get some of the local beer.  Afterwards
we went to a few other places and at one of them ended up meeting some Australian
guys I've seen earlier in the afternoon in the old town.  I always love meeting
other people who are travelling because they are most of the time easy going
and have some interesting stories to tell.

We ended up having lots of fun this night which lead to me having a very hard
time getting up at 8:00 to retrieve my Ferris.  But it amazed me how when
meeting other hackers during my trip I feel connected to them instantly like we
were knowing each others for years.

Since the weather was just too nice, I spent the next day visiting the `Bijela
Tabija castle`_ where one has a nice view over the city.  During my way up I
also enjoyed exploring this part of the city which consist of many small
streets and alleyways.

In the evening we had again lots of fun, this time visiting a sisha bar /
hookah lounge where there was some live music.  In the mean time I found out,
that the hackerspace which is mentioned in the HackerspaceWiki probably
doesn't exist.  So during the evening I talked with Czesiek and his friends
about founding one in Sarajevo.

The next day I slept in and then met with Czesiek for lunch and then proceeded
to visit his workplace in Sarajevo.  He works for the `Organized Crime and
Corruption Reporting Project`_ (OCCRP), which does a great job supporting
investigative journalism all over the world.

Since I wanted to avoid taking pictures of any sensitive material I just took a
picture of the door to the office ;)

Czesiek self described his work as follows:

    I'm a hacker at OCCRP, I'm in charge of developing editorial pipeline
    (newsroom software geared towards investigative journalist teams; we plan
    to opensource it after internal testing) and digital security.

After my short visit, I proceeded to verify if the hackerspace in Sarajevo
exists or not.  When arriving at the place it's supposed to be I found an
interesting technology hub called `HUB387`_.  Nobody there heard about a
hackerspace, so I changed the wiki entry to reflect that.  Because I was
already there and had no other plans, I rented a desk at the `NEST71`_
coworking space for €10 and spent some time working on this blog post.

In the evening there was a party at Czesiek's house and I had the pleasure to
meet more of the OCCRP crew and other interesting people.  I enjoyed the fact
that our group consisted of people from 7 different nations (Polish, French,
Bosnian, Mexican, American, British and Swiss)!

Despite having some slight trouble getting up on Saturday morning, Czesiek
and I attended a `protest`_ against violence towards LGBT people.  It was a
very peaceful and somewhat cheerful event.

After the protest we went for some coffee and I had the opportunity to meet
interesting people including a German guy who works for the European embassy.

In the afternoon I visited the `War Childhood Museum`_.  It was a very heart
touching experience, reading the stories of how children were experiencing the
war.  Also, after more than 20 years, marks of the war are still visible in
Sarajevo.

In the evening we went to the after party of the protest and again I met some
amazing people, amongst others Emina Bošnjak from the `Sarajevo Open Centre`_.

The next day I had a BlaBalCar booked for the early afternoon, so we just went
to Trebević mountain to enjoy the view and walk the way down.

I really loved my stay in Sarajevo.  Czesiek is an awesome host and I can
highly recommend to stay with him if you are in Sarajevo ;)

However, next stop: Zagreb, Croatia!

.. [#] This was my first BlaBlaCar ride. I can really recommend to travel with it!
